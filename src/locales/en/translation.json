  "about_text": "<strong style='color:#00ccff'>SOUL ROCK</strong> was born from a passion cultivated year after year, inspired by the glorious '80s and '90s—when music touched the soul and gave goosebumps. This love for authentic music merges with a deep appreciation for high-quality cuisine and for the iconic characters of rock and cinema. From this fusion comes the desire to share those celestial emotions with others, reigniting long-lost memories and awakening curiosity in those who never experienced that incredible era.<br><br>Through my journey and the various tests done in my restaurants, I realized I wasn't just offering good food and music, but something much more: emotion. Emotions that arise from an evocative setting filled with life-size statues that bring back to life beloved characters admired all around the world.<br><br>But I didn’t stop there. That’s how the idea was born to revive the voices we wish we could still hear—through cutting-edge high-definition holographic technology. This is how <strong style='color:#00ccff'>SOUL ROCK</strong> became the first <strong style='color:#00ccff'>MUSEUM RESTAURANT</strong> where departed legends sing once again, live among the tables.<br><br>Today, <strong style='color:#00ccff'>SOUL ROCK</strong> is more than just a restaurant—it's a <strong style='color:#00ccff'>MUSEUM RESTAURANT</strong>. A modern temple of collective memory where every detail is designed to make your heart beat faster.",
